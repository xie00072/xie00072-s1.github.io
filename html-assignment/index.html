            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year student in the <em>interactive media design program</em>. I have taught myself <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language"> HTML</abbr>,<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS</abbr>  before this course, and found programming is quite attractive. So I decided to change my line of work from engineering to <strong>internet industry</strong>. I hope I can get a job as a UX designer after completing this program.</p> 
            <p>My birthday is on April 1<sup>st</sup>, which is <em>April Fool's Day</em> . Each year, I am always tricked by my friends, but it somehow promotes our friendship. Besides, I am a passionate and curious person with a wide range of hobbies. Music is always what interests me most. I play the violin and the guitar. Meanwhile, I’m learning to arrange music.</p>
